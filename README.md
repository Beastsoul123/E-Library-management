## Overview

The `ELibrary` smart contract is a decentralized library system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to create, manage, and access digital resources in a secure and transparent manner. This contract leverages the Ethereum blockchain's immutability and decentralized nature to manage resource metadata and access rights.

## Vision

The vision of the `ELibrary` project is to create an immutable and decentralized platform for managing digital resources. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to ensure the integrity and availability of digital content while empowering creators with control over their works. This system seeks to eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and increase transparency in the management and distribution of digital resources.

## Features

- **Resource Creation:** Creators can add new resources to the library with metadata such as title, author, description, license, and public status.
- **Access Control:** Public resources can be accessed by anyone, while private resources are restricted to their creators and authorized users.
- **Resource Management:** Creators can update their resources' licenses and visibility (public/private status).
- **Events:** The contract emits events for resource creation and access, providing transparency and traceability.

## How It Works

1. **Add Resource:** Creators can add resources by providing the necessary metadata. A new resource is instantiated and stored in the mapping.
2. **Access Resource:** Users can access resources based on their public status or if they are the creator.
3. **Update License:** Creators can update the license associated with their resources.
4. **Update Public Status:** Creators can change the visibility status of their resources, making them public or private.

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Metadata:** Extend the metadata to include categories, tags, or ratings for better resource organization and searchability.
2. **Resource Reviews:** Implement a review and rating system for resources, allowing users to provide feedback and ratings.
3. **Access Control List:** Introduce a more granular access control mechanism where resource creators can specify which addresses have access to their private resources.
4. **User Profiles:** Create user profiles and portfolios where users can manage and display their created resources.
5. **Decentralized Storage:** Integrate with decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS) to store the actual content of resources, not just the metadata.
